test readme
This is a readme file dedicated to organizing my thoughts and concerns when dealing with (my soon-to-be) many problems when coding in the coming months. The purpose of this readme is to give myself an electronic notebook/journal just for practice. Once a Day I will post to this new readme listing things I've picked up along the way. They can either be direct code or pontifications about coding in a general sense. In this repository, anything goes. Post files like: pictures, videos, audio, text, .exe, etc.
